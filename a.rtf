To ensure clarity, maintainability, and ease of review, no existing statements have been modified or removed. Instead, all necessary changes have been introduced by adding new lines of code to `tcp_cubic.c`. This approach preserves the original structure and logic of the current version while making it easier to track modifications and maintain compatibility with future updates to the Linux kernel. To achieve this, a new module parameter, `hystartpp`, has been defined, along with a few additional variables instead of reusing similar ones from HyStart. For example, rather than reusing HyStart\'92s `curr_rtt` to track the minimum RTT in the current round, we introduced `hspp_current_round_minrtt`. In this implementation, HyStart++ overrides HyStart, meaning it controls the slow-start phase whenever the `hystartpp` module parameter is set to a nonzero value, regardless of the `hystart` setting.
